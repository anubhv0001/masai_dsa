<!--Build a task management web application with the following features:

Adding Tasks:
A text input and a button to add tasks. Each task should have a checkbox to mark it as completed and a delete button to remove it.
Filtering Tasks:
Three buttons to filter and display tasks:
All Tasks
Completed Tasks
Incomplete Tasks
Event Delegation:
Use event delegation to handle the delete and toggle completion actions efficiently.
Dynamic Counter:
Display a count of:
Total tasks
Completed tasks
Incomplete tasks
Sorting Tasks:
Add a button to sort tasks alphabetically.
Additional Notes:
Use map(), filter(), or similar HOFs to implement the filtering and sorting logic.
Ensure the UI dynamically updates based on user actions.-->
